# Setting up CentOS with Wordpress
## Downloading and installing CentOS 

First, download the CentOS ISO. It can be found [here](https://www.centos.org/download/)

I'm going to be using the CentOS Minimal ISO and we will install everything we need.

Once the ISO is done downloading, proceed to create a new virtual machine inside VMWare
or Virtual Box. Use the recommended settings for the allocated ram, storage, and cpu cores.
And when asked for network adapter, allow CentOS to access the Host-Only, DMZ adapter.
